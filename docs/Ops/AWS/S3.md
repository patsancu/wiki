### Get s3 data, having initial date and number of days to gather
If there's a set of folders named after dates, [this](https://gist.github.com/patsancu/267998d6852edc1388266ca03b002f20) works fine

### Sync folders
``` $ aws s3 sync s3://bucketname1/path/to/folder/2017-04-05 s3://bucketname1/path/to/folder/2017-04-05 ```
