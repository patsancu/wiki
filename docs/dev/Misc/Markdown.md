### Comments that only appear in the markdown document
* From [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20885980)
* It may be prudent to insert a blank line before and after this type of comments, because some Markdown parsers may not like link definitions brushing up against regular text.
```
[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)
```
or
```
[//]: <> (This is also a comment.)
```
or
```
[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
```
